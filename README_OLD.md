Door expansion pack for RImWorld.

1. Curtains - for the sake of fast movement through the houses and the tribal gameplay

- Made of textiles/leathers
- Very quick to open
- Highly fragile and flamable
- Provide temperature flow similar to vents
-Silent

2. Gates
A larger version of common doors, though larger

- Size 1x2
- Slower to open than normal doors of the same material
- Considerably tougher
- Variants (autodoors and options below) should apply 

3. Lockable doors - There is a mod dedicated to that, though imho there is some space for improvements

possible different tiers of locks
- simple key - a pawn needs to have a key in possesion to pass through the door
- sealed by a sign - an option for cults gameplay. just add a ritual, providing a headiff for the executioner, working the same way as a key. and may be spawn some kind of a  sigil working as a component for the door blueprint
- sci-fi one - basically the "Lockable doors" mod, adding a list of pawns that may go though the door, individual for each door

4. Remote controlled doors - I know that's imbalanced, though there is a lot of imbalanced features in mods nowadays

different tiers as well
- remote by wire (need a connection between the door and a console)
- remote by remote control (smth like in "remote explosives" mod, though I'm still thinking of a possible implementation)
- remote by AI control (requiring an AI core console) - simply open-close doors through the interface (FTL-style)
